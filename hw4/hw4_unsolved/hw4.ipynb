    "# Homework 4\n",
    "In this assignment, we will building a Naïve Bayes classifier and a SVM model for the productivity satisfaction of [the given dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Productivity+Prediction+of+Garment+Employees), the productivity of garment employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Questions 1-3:\n",
    "### Background \n",
    "The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Attribute Information\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **date**: Date in MM-DD-YYYY\n",
    "2. **day**: Day of the Week\n",
    "3. **quarter** : A portion of the month. A month was divided into four quarters\n",
    "4. **department** : Associated department with the instance\n",
    "5. **team_no** : Associated team number with the instance\n",
    "6. **no_of_workers** : Number of workers in each team\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Libraries that can be used: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, cvxpy, imbalanced-learn\n",
    "Any libraries used in the discussion materials are also allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Notes\n",
    "\n",
    " - Don't worry about not being able to achieve high accuracy, it is neither the goal nor the grading standard of this assignment. <br >\n",
    " - If not specified, you are not required to do hyperparameter tuning, but feel free to do so if you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trouble Shooting\n",
    "In case you have trouble installing and using imbalanced-learn(imblearn) <br >\n",
    "Run the below code cell, then go to the selection bar at top: Kernel > Restart. <br >\n",
    "Then try `import imblearn` to see if things work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "we are also working on a list of 1200 bitstrings, where each of them contains 16 bits. <br >\n",
    "We will apply K-means Clustering, and PCA to this dataset for Q4-5. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background and Data Information Q4-5\n",
    "For a bitstring $S$ in this dataset, we describe $S = \\{s_{15}, s_{14}, s_{13}, s_{12}, \\ldots, s_{0} \\}$, where $s_{15}$ is often known as the most significant bit (MSB) and $s_0$ as the least significant bit (LSB). <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "There are duplicated bitstrings in this dataset, but they will not affect this assignment. Don't worry about them. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equivalence Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is an important concept to Exercise 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say if we have two bitstrings, $A = \\{a_{15}, a_{14}, a_{13}, \\ldots, a_{0} \\}$ and $B = \\{b_{15}, b_{14}, b_{13}, \\ldots, b_{0} \\}$. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "We can flip one bit $a_i$ in $A$ to get another bitstring $A'$, such that the difference of $A$ and $A'$ is only one bit. We define the above transformation to be $A \\to A'$. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We call two bitstrings $A$ and $B$ to be **equivalent** ($A \\sim B$) if there exists a sequence $A \\to C_1 \\to C_2 \\to \\cdots \\to C_n \\to B$, where $\\forall i, C_i$ belongs to the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that equivalence is both __commutative__ ($A \\sim B \\iff B \\sim A$) as well as __transitive__ ($A \\sim B, B \\sim C \\implies A \\sim C$). <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that the elements in the above sequence $\\{ A, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, B\\}$ form an equivalence class. Given a new bitstring $X$, we can see that if $X \\sim C_i$, $1 \\le i \\le n$, then $X$ will be added to the above equivalence class, and by the transitive property of equivalence relations, $X \\sim A$, and $X \\sim B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have 4 bitstrings, each of them is 4 bits long. They are $0000, 0010, 0110, 1100$, respectively.<br >\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say $0000 \\sim 0110$ because $0000 \\to 0010 \\to 0110$. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $0000 \\nsim 1100$. There may be sequences like $0000 \\to 1000 \\to 1100$ or $0000 \\to 0100 \\to 1100$, but neither $1000$ nor $0100$ is in our dataset. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, $\\{0000, 0010, 0110\\}$ form an equivalence class, whereas $\\{1100\\}$ is the other. As a result, there are two classes."

    "## Exercise 1 - General Data Preprocessing (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset needs cleaning before building any models. Some of the cleaning tasks are common in general, but depends on what kind of models we are building, sometimes we have to do additional processing. These additional tasks will be mentioned in each of the remaining two exercises later.\n",
